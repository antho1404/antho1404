I’m a developer and entrepreneur who’s been building tools for startups and founders for over 15 years. I’ve spent more than a decade in Web3 and am now exploring the frontier of AI—always staying close to what’s next in tech.

Based in Thailand for over 10 years, originally from France and father of 1.
