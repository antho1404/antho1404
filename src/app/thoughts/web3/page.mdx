# I Spent 10 Years in Web3. Here’s Why I’m No Longer Hyped — And What Needs to Change

As a developer and entrepreneur, I was hooked by this idea of a decentralized infrastructure where money was part of everything.  
It felt perfect: you could build a product without worrying about servers, redundancy, or infrastructure, and at the same time, you could monetize however you wanted.

Not with just one-shot payments or subscriptions, but by designing actual economies into your product — _pay-per-use models_, _new monetization mechanics_, and _business models we’d never seen before_.  
That was exciting to me. That’s why I jumped in.

## The Vision That Pulled Me In

Over the past 10 years, I built two companies in the Web3 space — one bootstrapped, one VC-backed.  
I’ve been on both sides: issuing a token, staying away from tokens, navigating hype cycles, and helping businesses of all sizes — from indie builders to top-tier players worth hundreds of millions, sometimes billions.

And almost all of them shared what I now see as the core issue in Web3: **tokens**.

At first, the promise felt magical.  
Create a token (crypto or NFT), give it a hint of utility, stir up some FOMO, and sell it to a wave of underinformed investors.  
Meanwhile, try to reverse-engineer a product around that token — at any cost.

> What could possibly go wrong?

## The Token Trap

As the space matured, tokens became the default fundraising model — ICOs, TGEs, IDOs, you name it.  
And with that came a shift: projects stopped thinking long-term.  
The goal wasn’t to build something meaningful — it was to grow fast, launch a token, and cash in.

VCs started chasing early-stage discounts for quick flips. <br/>
Founders optimized for launches, not retention. <br/>
What followed was a predictable loop: **pump, dump, disappear**.

Worse, it became the standard.  
If you weren’t playing the game, you couldn’t raise.  
So even promising teams caved — cutting corners, bloating roadmaps, and warping their product just to fit a token narrative.  
Welcome **tokenomics**.

It created a cycle where the average project’s lifespan was just a few months — and where **real innovation had no room to breathe**.

## Normies Never Came

One of the recurring themes in Web3 was always the same:

> "How do we bring in the masses?"

A lot of effort went into onboarding "normies" — gamers, casual users, regular people.  
But the core problem never changed: most projects were built around the token, not the user.

At [Liteflow](https://liteflow.com/), we had countless projects come to us with the same question:

> "How do I bring more utility to my token?"
> And almost every time, the real answer was:
> "Are you sure you need this token?"

But no one wanted to hear that.

Because the truth is, **most people don’t care** about compounding yields, governance mechanics, or staking strategies.  
They don’t want to think like investors just to play a game or use a product.

And wallets? Wallets are a mess.  
There are dozens of them — if not hundreds — and each app needs to support too many just to avoid backlash from "Web3 users".  
The result is a fragmented, fragile, painful onboarding flow that’s nearly impossible to explain to someone outside the space.

And once you finally manage to create a wallet, you hit the final boss of bad UX:

> "Buy my token to unlock this feature."

**Web3 adoption didn’t fail because of tech — it failed because it chased tokens over users.**

## Blockchain Found Its Niche — and It’s Not You

For years, I believed blockchain could power more than just money.  
That we could run entire apps on-chain — messaging, documents, media, productivity tools — and enable fairer, pay-per-use models with native monetization built in.

I imagined:

- an on-chain Google Docs
- a decentralized Discord
- a blockchain-powered Spotify
- marketplaces that actually respected creators
- infrastructure that just worked — no servers, no middlemen
- ...

But none of that ever happened.

The dream was clear.  
The execution never came.  
Because the reality is: blockchain is great for one thing — **money**.

- DeFi works.
- Financial tooling works.
- Speculation, trading, fundraising — this is where blockchain found product-market fit.

And that’s okay.  
But let’s stop pretending it’s something it’s not.

## What’s My Hope

I don’t think blockchain needs to change.  
It found its place — and that place is **money**.  
That’s fine.

What I _do_ hope is that builders stop lying to themselves — and to their users.

1. If you’re building a good product, then build a good product.
2. **Web3 or not.**
3. If crypto fits, use it. But maybe start with **stablecoins** — _something people can actually understand and use._
4. If you really want to launch a token, go ahead.
5. Just be honest: **it’s about raising money**, not delivering value.

At least meme coins are honest.  
No pitch deck. No utility.  
Just: _"We’re here to speculate."_  
Ironically, that’s more transparent than most token projects I’ve seen.

**That’s not what drives me anymore.**

What drives me is helping founders and startups **build real things** — with actual value for real users.  
And after 10 years in Web3, I’ve realized that means stepping out of the hype — and getting back to work.
